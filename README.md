### Demo

![demo](./demo.gif)

##### Logseq.App

- `registerSlashCommand: (tag: string, action: BlockCommandCallback | Array<SlashCommandAction>) => boolean`
- `onMacroRendererSlotted: IUserSlotHook<{ payload: { arguments: Array<string>, uuid: string, [key: string]: any } }>`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The current implementation may have performance issues,
> especially when there are too many running timer instances.
> That's because time ticker needs messaging frequently between
> host and plugin sandbox. We are exploring better solutions for
> the rendering of block content partly.
